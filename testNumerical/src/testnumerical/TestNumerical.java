    // BigDeciBigDecimal is a class in Java that provides arbitrary-precision arithmetic for working with decimal numbers. It is part of the java.math package and is commonly used when precise calculations are required, such as in financial or monetary calculations.
    //Unlike primitive data types like double or float, which have a fixed number of bits to represent a number and can therefore introduce rounding errors, BigDecimal allows you to perform calculations with arbitrary precision. It stores the value as a scaled integer and includes methods for performing mathematical operations, comparisons, and formatting.
    //MathContext is a class in Java that allows you to control the precision and rounding behavior of mathematical operations performed with BigDecimal. It belongs to the java.math package and is used in conjunction with BigDecimal to specify the desired precision and rounding rules.
    //Stripped thrilling zeros is used to eliminate unnecessary 0
    //Rounding mode HALF_UP is one of the rounding modes available in Java's BigDecimal class and MathContext class. It is commonly used to round a number to the nearest neighbor, with ties rounded up. Here's how it works:
    homePage home=new homePage();
    }
   
    }
